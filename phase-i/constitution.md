# Evolution of Todo - Phase I Constitution (Full Progression)

## Principles
1. **Clean Code**: Prioritize readability and maintainability through modular functions and clear naming.
2. **Spec-First**: Implementation always follows architectural plans and behavioral specifications.
3. **No External Dependencies**: Phase I MUST use Python built-in modules only (datetime, re, shlex) to maintain a lightweight, portable footprint.
4. **Rich Console UX**: Use professional ANSI formatting and symbols to make the CLI feel interactive and productive.
5. **Intelligent Automation**: Leverage built-in logic for task recurrence and proactive reminders.
